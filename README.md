##  How the App Works

- When the page loads, the app fetches **10 random dog images**.
- Each image contains a **breed name**, extracted from its URL.
- A **text input** (`breedFilter`) allows users to **filter** the displayed images by breed.
- As the user types, the images are filtered **in real-time** by matching the breed part of the image URL.
- All logic is handled in **vanilla JavaScript**, and images are displayed dynamically using DOM manipulation.
