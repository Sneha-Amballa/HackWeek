# Simple_API_Data_viewer

This is a simple web application that uses the **Dog CEO API** to display random dog images and allows users to filter them by breed name.

---

##  API Used

**Dog CEO Dog API**  
 https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

Endpoints used:
- `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/10`  
  → Fetches 10 random dog images across all breeds.

---

##  How the App Works

- When the page loads, the app fetches **10 random dog images**.
- Each image contains a **breed name**, extracted from its URL.
- A **text input** (`breedFilter`) allows users to **filter** the displayed images by breed.
- As the user types, the images are filtered **in real-time** by matching the breed part of the image URL.
- All logic is handled in **vanilla JavaScript**, and images are displayed dynamically using DOM manipulation.
